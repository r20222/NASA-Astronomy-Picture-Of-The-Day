# NASA-Astronomy-Picture-Of-The-Day

This project was made with the APOD API from NASA. 
Find NASA API's here: https://api.nasa.gov/

I made this project to practice with API data and to practice with POST so you can leave messages.

## How does it work?

Everyday NASA chooses a picture to be the picture of the day. You can choose with the date picker which date you want to see the picture of. If you want to comment on a picture, you could do so in the comment section.
